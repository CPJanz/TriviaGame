## Description of Play
Is presented with a series of mutiple choice questions and a time limit to answer each one. Correct and Incorrect answer tallies are kept. After 10 questions, the player is presented with the choice to play again.

## Purpose
This was an assignment for coding bootcamp focusing on timers and jquery DOM manipulation.


## Feedback
I started with getting a MVP html set up before beginning to code javascript this time which worked well. I also used TODO tags liberally as I was sketching out the code and found that to be immensely helpful in allowing me to focus on small portions of code.

I welcome any feedback on the choices I made (especially on the html and css side).
